                   <h5> What is PiggyVest?</h5>
PiggyVest helps you save and invest with ease. With PiggyVest, you can stop spending excessively and put away (and grow!) funds that you do not want to touch.

You can choose to save little amounts of money periodically (Daily, Weekly or Monthly) towards a specific target OR lock away funds for a specified period of time. 

We take away the stress by combining simplicity, discipline, convenience, and flexibility to enable you to manage your finances better and achieve financial freedom.
<h5>>How do I know what plan is right for me?</h5>
<p>All of the savings and investment options on Piggyvest are tailored towards a particular need. 

If you'd like to regularly put away money for your savings and withdraw only once a quarter, then the Piggybank wallet is right for you. You can set it so that money is taken from your account and you don't have to worry about saving manually. 
If you're saving towards a particular goal such as rent or travel, Target Savings is a great option. You can invite friends and make it a fun challenge to smash all your financial goals. 
If you're looking for something geared towards the long term, The SafeLock feature is perfect for you. With higher interest rates, you could lock away funds you don't need access to and make even more money by doing so. 
If you're looking to get started on investments or diversify your portfolio, then pre-vetted, low-risk investment opportunities are regularly available on Investify to help you grow your money.</p>

                    What is Piggybank
                    This is a feature that helps you build financial discipline by allowing you to automatically save any amount daily, weekly or monthly. You also have an option to save manually.
                    
                    Do I have to login every time I want to save?
                    No, everything is done automatically once you have set up your Autosave, except you want to top up your savings using the QuickSave option. 
                    To keep track, all transactions on your debit card will be visible on your dashboard. We will also send an email receipt to you every single time you save with your card, and your bank will send you an alert as well. It's 100% secure.
                    Can I pause and continue saving anytime?
                    Yes, you can, it is up to you to pause or continue the automatic saving any time for free. Login to your account, go to your Savings and select "Turn off Autosave" from the Piggybank savings option.
                    What happens when I finally have money and I missed some days, weeks or months?
                    We WON'T automatically debit your account if you missed any day, week or month and we WON'T charge you either. The QuickSave option is always available for you to manually make up for any lost day, week or month.
                    Can I increase my savings at anytime?
                    Yes, you can increase the amount you're saving at anytime. Simply login and click 'modify AutoSave instruction', then edit the amount. You can also edit your frequency to either daily, weekly or monthly.
                    What if I don't have funds in my account or debit card?
                    Simple! We will not be able to debit you for that day, week or month. We will only be able to save for you when you have funds in your debit card. However, you have the option to use the "Quick save" option once you have loaded your account.
                    What is Quick Save and how does it work?
                    This option basically enables you to add more funds to your savings. For example, if you set N1,000 daily and you miss a day or two, you can use the quick save option to deposit N2,000 or N3,000 at once. This is to ensure you meet up with your savings target.
                    
                    You can add up to N500,000 at once with this option. However, you can add this multiple times in a single day. For instance, if you want to add N1,000,000, you need to add N500,000 twice.
